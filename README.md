# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This workday scheduler web application was created to give users the ability to schedule a typical workday, perfect for people who find themselves busy at work and need a way to schedule tasks for their day by the hour. Users can save hourly tasks and come back to them later, in order to eliminate unstructured or wasted time during the workday. Working on this project allowed me to learn more about using JQuery, Bootstrap, and DayJS APIs.

## Usage
This web application can be accessed at the URL (https://ronbuttermore.github.io/workday-scheduler/). The current day can be viewed by the user in the header at the top of the page, which will update on refresh. The user can input tasks in the text box for each hour to schedule out their workday, and then click on the "save" icon to the right of the text box to save their tasks. If the user closes the page and re-opens it, they will see their tasks saved for each hour.

## Credits
The HTML and CSS for this application was mostly built by the University of Denver Coding bootcamp staff, while I wrote all of the JavaScript code that creates the functionality of the webpage.
